This is an engineering project where I developed a connection between PLC controllers and the Azure cloud. In the Azure cloud, there was an InfluxDb database and an ASP.NET web application. The website displayed graphs of parameter changes in the PLC and tables with their values. A desktop application connected to the PLC controller using the OPC UA protocol and collected the appropriate data from it.
